# Christian P. Newkirk

Welcome to Chao in Space II! This is a sonic fan-game put together as a side project in my spare time. None of the sprites are mine and some of the code is originally from tutorials. Check out the credit below to see where everything is from.

Click [here](https://cpnewkirk.github.io/myGame/) to start exploring! This is loosly-optimized for mobile devices as well, but you get the best expereience on a desktop.

## Installation

This code does not need to be downloaded. Simply view in-browser by clicking [this link](https://cpnewkirk.github.io/myGame/).

To run this code locally, clone this repo, open it in your terminal, then run this code.

```
npm open index.html
```

## Technologies Used

This project relies on Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I used JQuery for the first time in the tamogatchi minigame and really enjoyed it. In the future I will look for more opportunities to expand my knowledge with JQuery functions.

## Implementation

Firsts I brainstormed what kind of game I wanted to make and what skills I wanted to learn. I knew I wanted to create something that challenged me with different kinds of logic and something that felt dynamic and fun to a user. Creating a fan-game meant I wanted it to include as many characters as I could and I was able to find some great resources from other fans and combine them into this project. It was fun thinking of world-building and how each character would interact with Sonic or what kind of minigame would suit them.

## Challenges

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was incorporating the different minigames into the overworld. Each tutorial had a working game on its own, but most did not use a class structure the way I was calling it from the help menu. This proved challenging when streamlining the code because certain functions had very specific use cases and were not easily converted to class methods. Overcoming this meant digging down into definitions and learning more about Javascript.

## Bugs

- Save does not save you data long term. This feature needs to be fully implemented in the future.
- On mobile, if you tap a direction button and hold, then move to another button and let go, you will be stuck going in that direction unless you tap the button again.
- Some of the styling for mobile is not correct when full screen is on.

## Future Work

- Additional map to the west.
- Additional map to the east.
- Side-quest with Rouge collecting 100 rings from other characters then purchasing an artifact to bring to Vector.
- Fully implement save functionality.
- Re-style minigames with the line appearing at bottom of page.
- Re-style runner game because of bad visilibilty.
- Refactor treasure game to find a chaos emerald at the end.
