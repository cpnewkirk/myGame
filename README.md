Welcome to Chao in Space II! This is a sonic fan-game put together as a side project in my spare time. None of the sprites are mine and some of the code is originally from tutorials. Check out the credit below to see where everything is from.

Click [here](https://cpnewkirk.github.io/myGame/) to start exploring! This is loosly-optimized for mobile devices as well, but you get the best expereience on a desktop.

## Installation

This code does not need to be downloaded. Simply view in-browser by clicking [this link](https://cpnewkirk.github.io/myGame/).

To run this code locally, clone this repo, open it in your terminal, then run this code.

## Technologies Used

This project relies on Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Implementation

Firsts I .

## Challenges

One of the most .

## Bugs

- On mobile, if you tap a direction button and move to another button then let go, you will be stuck going in that direction unless you tap the button again.
- Some of the styling for mobile is not correct when full screen is on.

## Future Work

I want to add a map to the west and the east.
